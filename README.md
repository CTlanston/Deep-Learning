# Summary of Deep Learning Models and Techniques in Projects

## 1. **Linear Regression and Generalized Linear Model (GLM)**:
   - **Techniques**: Logistic regression and linear regression models for predicting credit card default and startup success.
   - **Application**: Used for binary classification (credit default) and general prediction tasks in startups.
   - **Model**: Logistic regression with significant predictors, and linear regression for continuous data prediction (log volume).

## 2. **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**:
   - **Techniques**: Feedforward neural networks with dropout regularization for credit card default classification.
   - **Application**: Used to predict whether a customer will default.
   - **Model**: A neural network with a single hidden layer and sigmoid activation for binary classification.

## 3. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**:
   - **Techniques**: Convolutional layers, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers for image classification.
   - **Application**: Image classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
   - **Model**: CNN architecture with two convolutional layers, followed by dense layers for multi-class classification.

## 4. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**:
   - **Techniques**: Simple RNN layers for sequential data, designed to capture temporal patterns.
   - **Application**: Predicting time series data (log volume) from the NYSE dataset.
   - **Model**: RNN with a single recurrent layer followed by a dense layer.

## 5. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**:
   - **Techniques**: LSTM units, a special type of RNN for learning long-term dependencies in sequential data.
   - **Application**: Time series forecasting for air pollution levels in a multivariate setting.
   - **Model**: LSTM network with multiple lag features for forecasting.
